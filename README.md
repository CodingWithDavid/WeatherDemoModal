## Why

Blazor is a new and exciting new SPA framework that allows me to build interactive web applications using C# that runs in the browser.  Blazor allows me to use my existing skills with a single tool set to build highly interactive web app.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```Command Line
   git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/WeatherDemoModal
   cd WeatherDemoModal
   ```

1.	Open in Visual Studio or Visual Code
a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions
2.	Press F5

## What's in the App

The user will be able to add a new city and enter in the tempature for that city.  Once added, the user will be able to edit that city's tempature.  To add the cit we are using another page user experiance, while for the city edit, we are using a modal.
